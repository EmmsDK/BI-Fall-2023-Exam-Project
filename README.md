# Stage 1: Problem Definition

**Objective:** Foundation of a business case and problem statement

At this stage, you brainstorm, browse sources of inspiration and information, collect ideas, and discuss business or social domains where Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can bring value.

## Idea 1: Analyzing the Impact of High Inflation on Data Scientists

**Title:** Saving Money as a Data Scientist in a High Inflation Era.

**Description:** This project aims to predict the potential time and money savings for Data Scientists working remotely in the US during a high inflation era. We will first calculate the costs associated with commuting to work and compare them to remote work savings. Additionally, we will predict the inflation rate in the US 20 years into the future. Lastly, we will assess how long it would take to afford an expensive dream car, factoring in the savings, and explore the necessary salary increases in a high inflation era.

**Answering the Following Questions:**
- How much time did you save on remote work?
- How much money did you save on remote work?
- How many years would it take for you to buy your dream car?
- What is the impact of remote work on your finances?

## Annotation of the Project

**Challenge Addressed:** This project addresses the challenge of persistent high inflation rates and stagnant salaries in the post-COVID-19 era, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

**Importance/Interest of Research Goal:** The rising cost of living has made it challenging for individuals to achieve their ambitions, such as purchasing expensive items like luxury cars. Our project aims to provide a solution by allowing users, such as data scientists, to predict the time and financial investment required to reach these ambitious goals before the years pass.

**Expected Solution:** The expected solution of our project is to provide an eye-opening perspective for users, especially data scientists living an average middle-class, spontaneous lifestyle with no financial discipline or life planning. It will help them realize the challenges of buying luxury items in today's economic environment and encourage them to explore alternative financial strategies.
