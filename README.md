| Saving money as a data scientist in a high inflation era.    |
| **Description**                               |
| Predict how much time and money you could save in the future working as a Data Scientist, doing remote instead of physical work in the US. Firstly, we would see from a data scientist salary how much money and time it would cost to drive to work in the US. Then we would compare how much saving there is by doing remote work at home. Secondly, we would predict the inflation rate in the US, 20 years into the future. Lastly, we would compare how much time it would take to buy an expensive dream car [Insert expensive dream car here] with vs without the savings. Also, we would see how much the salary should increase in the high inflation era.  |
