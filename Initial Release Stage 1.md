| Saving money as a data scientist in a high inflation era.    |
| **Description**                               |
| Predict how much time and money you could save in the future working as a Data Scientist, doing remote instead of physical work in the US. Firstly, we would see from a data scientist salary how much money and time it would cost to drive to work in the US. Then we would compare how much saving there is by doing remote work at home. Secondly, we would predict the inflation rate in the US, 20 years into the future. Lastly, we would compare how much time it would take to buy an expensive dream car [Insert expensive dream car here] with vs without the savings. Also, we would see how much the salary should increase in the high inflation era.  |
| **Answering the following questions**         |
| - How much time did you save on remote work? |
| - How much money did you save on remote work? |
| - How many years would it then take for you to buy your dream car? |
| - How big of an impact does remote work save you in money? |

# Project Title

**Business Intelligence Exams Project 2023 - Financial Resilience Strategies for Data Scientists in an Inflationary Economy**

## Project Annotation

**Challenge Addressed:** The challenge addressed by our project is the persistence of high inflation rates and stagnant salaries in the post-COVID-19 era, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

**Importance of Research Goal:** This research goal is important because the rising cost of living has made it challenging for individuals to achieve their ambitions, such as purchasing expensive items like luxury cars. Our project aims to provide a solution by allowing users, such as data scientists, to predict the time and financial investment required to reach these ambitious goals before the years pass.

**Expected Solution:** The expected solution to our project would provide the user, in this example a data scientist, to see if itâ€™s possible in comparison with an expensive dream item to achieve, predict an outcome that would show how much time and money would be needed before the years have passed.

**Impact and Beneficiaries:** The impact of our solution would be to provide an eye-opening perspective for users, especially data scientists living an average middle-class, spontaneous lifestyle with no financial discipline or life planning. It will help them realize the challenges of buying luxury items in today's economic environment and encourage them to explore alternative financial strategies.
